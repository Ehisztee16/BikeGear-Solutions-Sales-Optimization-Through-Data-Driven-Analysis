# Project Overview

BikeGear Solutions is a multinational retailer of cycling accessories operating in Canada, the U.S., and Australia. Leadership needed a deeper understanding of sales patterns across regions, age groups, and product categories so they could make better decisions about marketing, inventory, and product focus.

# Business Problems

Some of the challenges BikeGear Solutions struggled with that created blind spots in marketing strategy, inventory decisions, and overall business planning are:

- **Unclear regional revenue performance:** Leadership did not know which countries or states were generating the most revenue, making it hard to target profitable regions or identify underperforming ones.

- **Uncertainty about customer demographics:** Leadership lacked insight into which age groups were buying their products, making targeted marketing difficult.

- **Limited understanding of product popularity:** Leadership did not know which subcategories or products were high-performing versus low-performing.

- **Difficulty predicting seasonal sales trends:** Without visibility into monthly or seasonal patterns, the business struggled to plan inventory and promotions effectively.

# Dashboard & Insights

With the aid of the Excel analysis important discoveries that revealed key insights are shown on the dashboard some of which are: certain regions generated higher revenue, distinct demographic drove most purchases, top-performing product categories stood out, sales were seasonal it showed a rise in purchases during cycling seasons and around holidays, profitability varied by product type and region.

# Recommendations

These recommendations are on the back of the above insights

- Target high-performing regions with tailored marketing: Increase advertising spend and promotional activities in regions with the strongest revenue performance.

- Strengthen marketing toward top demographic segments: Create age-targeted campaigns for segments that buy the most, especially Young Adults and Adults.

- Expand inventory for high-demand product subcategories: Ensure adequate stock for top-selling items and consider introducing new variations or bundles.

- Improve management of low-selling product lines: Consider discounting, bundling, redesigning, or discontinuing weak-performing products.

- Plan marketing campaigns around seasonal peaks: Launch promotions before expected demand spikes to capture maximum sales.

- Refine inventory planning using seasonality trends: Increase stock prior to busy months to prevent shortages and reduce inventory during low seasons to minimize waste.

# Conclusion
Through the insight and recommendation of this project, BikerGear was furnished with data-driven analysis that unveiled customer behaviour, regional performance, product demand, and seasonal patterns. Leadership clearly sees the need to optimize marketing, inventory, and product strategies making it easier to drive growth across regions and product segments.
